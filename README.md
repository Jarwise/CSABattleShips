# CSABattleShips

One player Battleships game, where player plays agains a simple algorithm. 
The point of the game is to track down all of the opponents ships in his grid, while not getting all of your ship shot down meanwhile.

Game starts by placing your ships into the grid (for now the set of ships consists of 6 ships (5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2) but can be easily changed), 
you can place ships into the grid by inserting coordinated of the wanted fields in format "vB6" where v stands for verticaly and h for horizontaly, letter specifies the column and number the row of the upper left corner of the ship in the grid. You can also notice that the grid doesn't let you to place shit on the field where it would stick out of the board or right next to another ship (the green fields) therefore your ships have to be more spread out, fortunately bot generating his own ships also has to comply to the same rules. 
When you are done with placing your ships you will begin to see two grids every iteration - opponent's grid, which will be clear at this point and your task is to try to find all the enemy ships in this one and your own grid where your opponent tries to shoot your ships and you can see its progress.
Two 'players' are taking turns with an exception of when someone gets a ship, then that player get extra turn and the first one to find all of the opponent's ships wins.

Size of the grids is easily adjustable at the start of BattleShips.java file
